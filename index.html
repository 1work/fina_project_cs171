                    <p> COVID-19 has been the world's leading infectious killer,
                        taking away over 6 million lives from its inception to
                        the present day since the outbreak first started in 2019
                        in Wuhan, China. After the WHO declared it a global
                        pandemic in March 2020, the whole world was thrown into
                        disarray, but not all countries or populations suffered
                        to the same extent. The lived experience of those impacted
                        by COVID drastically varied from school to school, state to
                        state, and country to country. Throughout the past two years,
                        while many developed Western countries have seemingly
                        returned to pre-pandemic "normalcy", there are communities
                        who have and continue to face disproportionate adverse
                        consequences. This is a story about how COVID-19 became
                        the inequality virus, told in chronological order by its
                        causes and impact: Past (GDP), Present (Incarceration Healthcare
                        Access), and Future (Education Disruptions).

                <p> For many countries, the unequal health outcomes from the pandemic came from
                    poor resources and infrastructure that started long before the virus broke out.
                    Not all countries had access to the same networks, finances, and supply chains
                    to respond to COVID. Lower income countries in particular, left from decades of
                    imperialist exploitation by Europe and the Americas, created great disparities
                    in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and lack of preventative resources like vaccines
                    due to neoliberalism. </p>
                <p style="font-style: italic"> Take a look at the following scatterplot, which shows the
                    relationships between nations' GDPs and the total number of COVID vaccines (initial shot boosters, etc.)
                    obtained by their citizens. What do you notice?

            <p> It looks like GDP per capita positively correlates with vaccinations per 100 citizens
            in every region. This makes sense, since the higher resources you have per citizen, the
            better infrastructure you will have for purchasing larger quantities of vaccines and
            distributing them. </p>

                <p> As you can see, the regions with the highest GDP per Capita, like
                the Eastern Mediterranean countries, the European countries, and the Americas
                also have some of the highest average number of vaccine types. By contrast,
                countries in Africa and the Western Pacific, where most of the vaccines are produced by
                human labor and factories, have both the lowest GDP per capita and
                the lowest access to the total number of vaccines and the types of vaccines
                available. </p>

                <p>What does this mean for COVID inequality? Due to the vaccine being developed and primarily distributed
                    to high-income countries, many low-income countries are left with
                    little access to diverse vaccines. With supply chain difficulties, especially with the
                    transportation and storage of vaccines, countries that are far away from ports and trade
                    networks as well as those that are fewer resources have a much more difficult time procuring
                    the vaccines. Lower GDP per capita countries thus need help with both financial support and
                    infrastructure building to attain the same level of vaccination protection as their higher
                    GDP counterparts.

                <p> Since economic inequalities exacerbate COVID outcomes, what does it mean for
                    vulnerable populations in a single country? Let's first take a look at
                    the disparate outcomes in COVID survival and infection rates for one of the most
                    underserved communities in the U.S.: the incarcerated. </p>
                <p> Incarcerated individuals face an uphill battle as much of their rights are stripped away and have less access to good
                    healthcare. Without great resources for health prospects, it makes it much more likely for those
                    to not be vaccinated or to face higher mortality rates compared to the rest of the population as
                    their overall health is subpar compared to control groups. Let's see how the inmates
                    and prison staff fare in each state based on the state GDP. </p>

                    is the worldwide disruptions to student learning. Obtaining a quality education
                    is one of the most powerful sources of upward socioeconomic mobility, and lower

                <p> In the bar graph, one can see that the United States ranks relatively high in attendance rates
                compared to the rest of the world, but ranks middle of the pack compared to other developed
                nations. Those that are the most impacted by attendance rates from COVID are those in the
                African Continent and South East Asia.</p>
                <p>Knowledge is power and many of the most impacted communities are those with the least amount of
                    political influence and voice in society. Many lower-income countries do not have enough collective
                    bargaining power. Students are at a vulnerable age where they cannot vote and advocate for
                    themselves. Incarcerated individuals are often disenfranchised and many people are oblivious to
                    their plight. It is only by understanding the severity of the situation and advocating for others
                    can it is possible to enact top-down change and guarantee that everyone had a voice.</p>

                    lowest development indices; these countries need additional educational support
                    to catch their students up to the rest of the world. </h3>

                    <p> While we see the majority of the United States and many of the developed countries in the world
                        return to a semblance of normalcy, there are those who are still disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.
                        Incarcerated persons, citizens of middle and low-income countries, and students in primary
                        school are the most impacted in terms of survival rates, access to vaccines, and attendance in
                        schools. These all intersect with one another and create a compounded negative effect that far
                        outlasts the duration of the pandemic.</p>
                    <p> To address the inequities from the COVID-19 pandemic, we must address all three levels of
                        causes and impact, past, present and future, to stop a cycle of vulnerable countries and
                        populations from becoming even more harmed. </p>

                    <h5>Firstly, we must focus on building infrastructures
                        for buying and distributing vaccines in countries with low GDP.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Secondly, we must address
                        health gaps for people with low mobility like incarcerated individuals to prevent them
                        from being disproportionately harmed by lack of healthcare access.</h5>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Finally, we must share
                        knowledge and educational sources across the global South in order to help countries develop
                        their youth to fight the next pandemic.</h5>

                    <h3>About Us</h3>
                    <p> We are Minjue Wu (Team leader), Workneh Jano, and Jonathan Zhang are three Harvard undergraduates. As a group,
                        we have backgrounds in the History of Medicine, Social Studies, Political Science, Molecular and
                        Cellular Biology, and Computer Science, and we explored how the COVID pandemic has been felt differently by populations around the
                        world. We are especially interested in capturing the experiences of the most vulnerable
                        and marginalized demographics, including children (disruptions in education), the
                        incarcerated (healthcare provision in prison), and just in general how the pandemic
                        has impacted mobility to resources like groceries or the pharmacy. Our goal is to highlight
                        how COVID disproportionately impacts those who are the "Without (resources)",
                        and those with low social mobility and/or socioeconomic status. We are motivated by how
                        different we are pandemic experiences are compared to our family members in our native countries of
                        China and Ethiopia, which all have differing levels of resources and infrastructures of care compared
                        to our current base in the United States. We hope this project will help others analyze how
                        the pandemic has impacted issues of equity and social justice from a healthcare or political
                        science perspective.  </p>
